## Exploitation

Currently the exploit script generation hasn't been perfectly tailored for `sym_env` yet,
so the recommended way to test the generated exploits is:

```sh
# Disable ASLR
echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

# Clear all ENVs, set RSYNC_PROXY to the exploit string, and launch rsync with ::
env -i RSYNC_PROXY="`cat exploit-7fffffffef6d.bin`" ./CVE-2004-2093-rsync ::
```
